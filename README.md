# Impact of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth in Kenya
## Abstract
Over the last 5 years, Kenya has been experiencing a rise   in economic growth while FDI inflows steadily decrease annually. Primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) on Kenya’s economy(GDP). Previous empirical studies have yielded various conclusions regarding the association between these two variables. This analysis aimed to add to existing literature and provide a more recent view for comparison. Variables selected included GDP, FDI, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Inflation as the control variable. Secondary data for analysis was sourced from the World Bank within the period (1993-2022). The study adopted a quantitative research design using STATA software version 15.0, SPSS and Microsoft Excel which facilitated data analysis through descriptive statistics and  multiple regression analysis for report creation from our findings. The multiple regression revealed that 98% of the variation  in Kenya’s  GDP can be explained by our model. According to the coefficients of the independent variables we found, FDI had a negative but insignificant impact on GDP. Inflation rate also had a negative impact, while manufacturing and infrastructure had positive impact on economic growth. Infrastructure was the only variable to have a significant impact on economic growth, highlighting the need for infrastructure development. The observed negative impact of FDI on economic growth is statistically insignificant (p= 0.181>0.05), hence the observed impact remains inconclusive. Our analysis informs policy makers  to take part in bilateral and multilateral trade  agreements to open up the economy to foreign investments  and  implement anti-corruption policies to create an investor friendly environment and protect local firms. The government should also focus on critical infrastructure specifically transport networks, power supply and digital connectivity.


# Introduction
## Background of study
Foreign Direct Investment(FDI) is recognized as a significant contributor to economic growth. This can be achieved because FDI avails capital, technology and knowledge transfers, job creation and creating trade networks to the benefit of industries.  However, it is also important to acknowledge the negative externalities that can occur, such as replacement of local firms and exploitation of local resources. Nevertheless, with well-structured laws and policies, the negative effects can be mitigated. To attract FDI, the government needs to create a more attractive business environment and improve infrastructure. 

## Objectives
1.This study aims to determine the significance of FDI on economic growth in Kenya.
2. Determine impact of infrastructure on economic growth.

# Methodoogy
## Research Design
The study utilized Quantitative research design since our variable were numerical. Ordinary Least Squares method was adopted to create a regression model.

## Data Source
Secondary time series data was collected from the World Bank, within the period (1993-2022)
